# Proposal to Refocus on Superchain, especially Base

## Summary
DackieSwap is currently a multichain DEX operating across 9 chains, with Base as our primary chain. We've observed that some chains outside the Superchain ecosystem are not performing efficiently. This proposal seeks DAO approval to refocus our efforts on the Superchain ecosystem, particularly Base.

## Objectives and Benefits
- Focus growth efforts on Base and other chains within the Optimism Superchain ecosystem
- Leverage Base's robust ecosystem and significant liquidity flows
- Position ourselves strategically for future expansion to other Superchains as the ecosystem matures (note: DACKIE Superchain token already has native Superchain support)

## Detailed Plan
- Concentrate resources on Base (primary focus), Optimism, Mode, and Worldchain
- Monitor potential expansion opportunities on emerging Superchains such as Unichain and Ink
- Delist chains outside the Superchain ecosystem, including Arbitrum, Linea, Blast, X Layer, and inEVM (currently TVL not too much)
- keep delisted chains in Legacy url (with low priority support and feature)

## Conclusion
This strategic realignment will allow us to better focus our resources and development efforts on the most promising ecosystem while maintaining our commitment to multichain functionality within the Superchain network.
