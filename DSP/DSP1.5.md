## Summary:
DackieSwap just launch a strategic product - [an algorithmic stable-coin Dackie USD (dckUSD)](https://dackie.mirror.xyz/8dJ-Q-FtZngv7dgq2b_gr5xhwxwA3rJoxHBbepM5ggw). This proposal outlines the introduction of incentive programs for four new liquidity pools on the DackieSwap: 
* Base:
    ```
    ETH-dckUSD - V3 - 0.01% 
    USDC-dckUSD - V3 - 0.01%
    ``` 
These pools are designed to enhance liquidity and trading activity for dckUSD on DackieSwap, benefiting both users and the broader DackieSwap ecosystem.

## Objectives and Benefits:
The primary objective of this proposal is to incentivize liquidity providers to supply assets to the specified dckUSD pairs with ETH and USDC. By doing so, we aim to achieve the following benefits:

* Increase Liquidity: Enhance the liquidity in these trading pairs to reduce slippage for traders and improve overall market efficiency. That also attract user join to do arbitrage, keep peg for dckUSD.
* Strengthen Token Ecosystem: Promote the utility and importance of the dckUSD token through active trading and use in different pools.
* Community Growth: Utilize the incentives as a means to engage and expand our community base, enhancing user retention and new user acquisition.

## Detail Proposal:
The detail incentive structure is designed as below table:

| Chain     | Pools         | Type       | Current Emission | New Emission   |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| Base      | Other pools   | -          | 28,343,321       | 28,343,321     |
| Base      | ETH - dckUSD  | V3 - 0.01% | 0                | 1,259,516      |
| Base      | USDC - dckUSD | V3 - 0.01% | 0                | 839,688        |
| **Total** |               |            | ~~28,343,321~~   | **30,442,627** |


## Implementation Plan:
Setup new dckUSD pools in Base (3 days after proposal passed).

## Conclusion:
This proposal aims to significantly strengthen the DackieSwap ecosystem by launching new incentive-driven liquidity pools. It supports our strategic goals of increasing liquidity, expanding user engagement, and solidifying the dckUSD tokenâ€™s importance and utility. We believe these steps will lead to a more dynamic and robust trading environment on the DackieSwap.
