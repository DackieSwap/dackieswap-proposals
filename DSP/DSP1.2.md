## Summary:

We propose to update a **QUACK token emission rate** on Base from August.
A portion of QUACK is dedicated to our **Dackie Warriors Ambassador Program**, which helps to represent Dackie and promote it within our community.

  ```

  To align with [DSP1.1], which will have a portion of QUACK emission on X Layer, below is the breakdown:
  ```
  - Base: 315,000,000 per month
  - X Layer: 35,000,000 per month
  ```
