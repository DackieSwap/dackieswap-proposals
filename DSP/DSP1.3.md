## Summary:
This proposal outlines the introduction of incentive programs for four new liquidity pools on the DackieSwap: 
* Base:
    ```
    DACKIE-ETH V3 0.25% 
    DACKIE-USDbC V3 0.05%
    ```
* Optimism
    ```
    DACKIE-OP V3 0.25%
    ```
* Arbitrum
    ```
    DACKIE-ARB V3 0.25%
    ``` 
These pools are designed to enhance liquidity and trading activity for DACKIE token on DackieSwap, benefiting both users and the broader DackieSwap ecosystem.

## Objectives and Benefits:
The primary objective of this proposal is to incentivize liquidity providers to supply assets to the specified DACKIE pairs with ETH, USDC, OP, and ARB. By doing so, we aim to achieve the following benefits:

* Increase Liquidity: Enhance the liquidity in these trading pairs to reduce slippage for traders and improve overall market efficiency.
* Attract Users: Provide competitive returns to liquidity providers, commonly known as yield farming, to attract more users to the Dackie platform.
* Strengthen Token Ecosystem: Promote the utility and importance of the DACKIE token through active trading and use in different pools.
* Community Growth: Utilize the incentives as a means to engage and expand our community base, enhancing user retention and new user acquisition.

## Detail Proposal:
The detail incentive structure is designed as below table:
