## Detailed Proposal
The adjustment plan is in the table below, basically, reward on Base will be reduced to distribute reward on Blast, Mode and inEVM.

| Linea                 | 35,000,001      | 35,000,001  |
| Blast                 | 0               | 30,000,000  |

| **Total**             | 350,000,000     | 350,000,000 |

## Implementation Plan
- We will open incentive program on chains in order Blast, Mode, inEVM.
- Blast will be setup first, 1 day after proposal passed. Mode and inEVM will be setup in some next days.

## Conclusion
By implementing this proposal, we aim to significantly enhance liquidity on Blast, Mode, and inEVM, thereby boosting trading volume and strengthening the overall ecosystem. Engaging the Blast, Mode, and Injective communities will foster greater participation and growth within the DackieSwap ecosystem.

Additionally, deploying dckUSD on multiple chains and incentivizing rewards for dckUSD pairs will elevate its prominence and utility. Your support and participation are crucial for the success of this initiative, and we look forward to making DackieSwap a more robust and rewarding platform for all stakeholders.

_P/s: For Arbitrum, Optimism, and Blast, bridging DACKIE and QUACK may take more time compared to other chains because we use Axelar ITS instead of Layer Zero. If you experience delays, please remain patient._

We welcome all your feedback and look forward to your support in making this initiative a success.
